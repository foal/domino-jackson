Domino-jackson
=====
Domino-jackson is an annotation processor based JSON mapper that works on both the client side - [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/) and [J2CL](https://github.com/google/j2cl) - and on JVM side based, the library is based on [gwt-jackson](https://github.com/nmorel/gwt-jackson) the original thanks goes to [Nicolas Morel](https://github.com/nmorel) for building gwt-jackson library.

The library is future proofed and allows the user to use the same mapper to be used in a pure JVM environment such as Android or in the client side of the browser which enables easier testing and more code sharing between client and server.
